# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BioAI Workspace authentication system is experiencing critical errors during user signup and signin processes. Users are encountering "Missing environment variable JWT_PRIVATE_KEY" and "InvalidAccountId" errors that prevent successful authentication. This feature addresses these authentication issues by implementing comprehensive debugging, fixing configuration problems, and ensuring reliable user authentication flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging throughout the authentication process, so that I can identify and debug authentication failures quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to sign up THEN the system SHALL log each step of the signup process including validation, account creation, and JWT token generation
2. WHEN a user attempts to sign in THEN the system SHALL log authentication attempts, credential validation, and session creation steps
3. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including error codes, stack traces, and relevant context
4. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN the system SHALL log their presence/absence without exposing sensitive values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully create an account with email and password, so that I can access the BioAI Workspace features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide valid email and password credentials THEN the system SHALL create a new user account successfully
2. WHEN account creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a valid user session
3. IF account creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages explaining the failure reason
4. WHEN I attempt to create an account with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully sign in with my existing credentials, so that I can access my account and workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide correct email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate me successfully
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create a valid session with proper user context
3. IF I provide incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL return a clear authentication failure message
4. WHEN I sign in successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the main application interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment variable configuration, so that JWT authentication works correctly across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN JWT_PRIVATE_KEY is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration guidance
3. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL verify JWT key format and validity
4. IF environment configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent application startup with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling in the authentication system, so that users receive helpful feedback and system stability is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication operation fails THEN the system SHALL catch and handle errors gracefully
2. WHEN database operations fail during auth THEN the system SHALL retry appropriately and log failures
3. WHEN JWT operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about token issues
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and connection failures appropriately
