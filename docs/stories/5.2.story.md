# Story 5.2: Implement Real Molecular Analysis Tools

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** biomedical researcher,
**I want** real molecular analysis capabilities using scientific computing libraries,
**so that** I can perform authentic protein structure analysis, small molecule analysis, and PDB database searches instead of receiving mock data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. BioPython integration for protein structure analysis (secondary structure, binding sites, properties)
2. RDKit integration for small molecule analysis (molecular descriptors, properties, similarity)
3. Real PDB database API integration for structure search and retrieval
4. Molecular property calculations (molecular weight, logP, TPSA, hydrogen bonds)
5. Structure comparison and alignment capabilities using established algorithms
6. File format support for PDB, SDF, MOL, and other standard molecular formats
7. Async processing for computationally intensive molecular analysis tasks
8. Caching layer for expensive calculations and frequently accessed structures
9. Error handling for malformed molecular data and computational failures
10. API endpoints that replace the mock implementations in existing tools

> **Note:** This replaces the mock implementations currently in `src/services/langgraph/tools/molecularAnalysis.ts`, `pdbSearch.ts`, and `viewerControl.ts` with authentic scientific computing capabilities.

## Dev Notes
- **Scientific Accuracy**: All calculations must use peer-reviewed algorithms and established methods
- **Performance Considerations**: Molecular analysis can be computationally intensive; async processing required
- **Validation Strategy**: Compare results with established molecular analysis tools and literature values
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of malformed structures and computational edge cases
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain response format compatibility with existing Convex integrations
