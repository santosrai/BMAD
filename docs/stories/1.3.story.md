# Story 1.3: Add API Key Settings and Validation

## Status
Implemented

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to securely configure and validate my OpenRouter API key in the BioAI Workspace settings,
**so that** I can enable AI-powered biological analysis features while maintaining control over my API usage and costs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Settings page is accessible from authenticated user navigation
2. User can input OpenRouter API key in a secure form field
3. API key validation confirms connectivity to OpenRouter service
4. Valid API keys are stored securely in Convex user profile
5. Invalid API keys show clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
6. User can update/change their API key at any time
7. API key is masked in UI (showing only last 4 characters)
8. User can delete/remove their API key
9. Settings page shows API key status (configured/not configured, valid/invalid)
10. Real-time validation feedback during API key entry

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Story 1.1**: React/Vite/TypeScript foundation with navigation framework ready for settings integration
- **From Story 1.2**: User authentication and profile management established, providing secure context for API key storage

### Tech Stack & API Integration
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Model gateway requiring user API keys [Source: architecture/1-system-overview.md]
- **BYO API Key Model**: User-provided keys preferred initially [Source: prd/5-technical-assumptions-constraints.md]
- **Convex Storage**: Secure backend storage for user API keys [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Future AI Integration**: Foundation for LangGraph.js and OpenRouter connectivity [Source: architecture/2-system-diagram-flow.md]

### System Integration Points
- **Settings Navigation**: Integration with authenticated user navigation from Story 1.2
- **User Profile Extension**: Extend Convex user schema with API key storage
- **OpenRouter Connectivity**: Direct API validation against OpenRouter endpoints
- **Real-time Updates**: Convex real-time synchronization for API key status

### Data Models & Security
- **API Key Storage**: Encrypted storage in Convex user profile
- **Validation Data**: API key status, last validated timestamp, error states
- **Security Model**: Client-side masking, server-side encryption, secure transmission

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/pages/settings/` - Settings page components and routing
- `src/components/settings/` - API key management UI components
- `src/hooks/useApiKey.ts` - API key management and validation hooks
- `src/services/openrouter.ts` - OpenRouter API validation and client setup
- `convex/apiKeys.ts` - Secure API key storage and retrieval functions
- `src/utils/validation.ts` - API key format validation and security utilities

### OpenRouter API Key Requirements
- **API Key Format**: Standard OpenRouter API key format validation
- **Validation Endpoint**: Test connectivity with minimal API call
- **Error Handling**: Network errors, invalid keys, rate limits, service outages
- **Security**: Never log API keys, secure transmission, encrypted storage

### Integration Preparation
- **LangGraph.js Ready**: API key injection prepared for future AI workflow integration
- **Service Client**: OpenRouter client configuration using stored user API keys
- **Middleware Pattern**: API key retrieval and injection for AI service calls
- **Usage Monitoring**: Foundation for future API usage tracking (deferred to later epics)

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon Stories 1.1 and 1.2:
- Extend authenticated navigation with settings access
- Leverage existing user profile and Convex integration
- Follow established component patterns and styling
- Integrate with existing auth-protected routing system

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for API key validation logic and UI components
- Integration tests for OpenRouter API connectivity
- Security tests for API key storage and transmission
- UI tests for form validation and error handling
- End-to-end tests for complete API key management workflow

### Implementation Summary
Story 1.3 has been successfully implemented with all acceptance criteria met. The implementation includes:

**Backend (Convex):**
- Extended user schema with API key fields: `openrouterApiKey`, `apiKeyStatus`, `apiKeyLastValidated`, `apiKeyErrorMessage`

- Implemented encrypted storage and masked API key retrieval

**Frontend (React/TypeScript):**
- Created `/pages/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` with tabbed interface
- Built `/components/settings/ApiKeySettings.tsx` with comprehensive API key management UI
- Implemented `/hooks/useApiKey.ts` for state management and validation
