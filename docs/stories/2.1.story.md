# Story 2.1: Integrate Molstar 3D Viewer

## Status
InProgress

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** to have a 3D molecular viewer embedded in the BioAI Workspace,
**so that** I can visualize protein structures and molecular data within my authenticated workspace environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Molstar viewer is successfully embedded in the React application
2. Viewer renders in designated workspace area with proper responsive layout
3. Basic Molstar controls are functional (zoom, rotate, pan)
4. Viewer integrates with existing authentication and navigation structure
5. Sample PDB data can be loaded and displayed in the viewer
6. Viewer performance is optimized for desktop and tablet platforms
7. Loading states and error handling are implemented for viewer initialization
8. Viewer state persists across navigation within the workspace
9. Component follows established project styling and layout patterns
10. Browser compatibility is verified for target platforms

  - [ ] Test state persistence across different user interactions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Epic 1**: Complete foundation with React/Vite/TypeScript, user authentication, and Convex integration ready for viewer implementation
- **Authentication Context**: User sessions established, providing secure context for viewer state and preferences
- **Navigation Structure**: Basic navigation framework ready for viewer integration

### Tech Stack & 3D Viewer
- **3D Viewer**: Molstar for embedded molecular visualization [Source: architecture/1-system-overview.md]
- **React Integration**: Molstar embedded within React components [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Performance Target**: Desktop + tablet support with optimized rendering [Source: prd/5-technical-assumptions-constraints.md]
- **AI Integration Ready**: Foundation for future AI â†” Viewer interaction [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]

### System Integration Points
- **Workspace Layout**: Viewer component integrates with authenticated workspace UI
- **Session Management**: Viewer state stored in Convex user sessions
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with existing React Router structure
- **Future AI Readiness**: Prepared for LangGraph.js interaction capabilities

### Molstar Configuration Requirements
- **Basic Setup**: Standard Molstar viewer with essential 3D controls
- **Performance Config**: Optimized settings for web deployment and target devices
- **React Wrapper**: Custom React component wrapping Molstar functionality
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback for initialization and rendering failures

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/components/viewer/` - Molstar viewer React components
- `src/hooks/useMolstar.ts` - Custom hooks for Molstar state management
- `src/services/molstar.ts` - Molstar service configuration and utilities
- `src/pages/workspace/` - Workspace pages integrating viewer component
- `src/utils/viewer.ts` - Viewer utilities and helper functions
- `src/types/molstar.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for Molstar integration

### Performance Considerations
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize Molstar imports to minimize bundle impact
- **Rendering Performance**: Configure for smooth interaction on target platforms
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management for viewer lifecycle
- **Progressive Loading**: Implement loading strategies for better perceived performance

### Integration Patterns
- **Component Lifecycle**: Proper Molstar initialization and cleanup in React
- **State Management**: Viewer state integration with Convex real-time data
- **Event Handling**: React-friendly event handling for viewer interactions
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for robust viewer failure handling

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon Epic 1 foundation:
- Extend authenticated workspace with viewer integration
- Follow established component patterns and styling
- Leverage existing Convex integration for state persistence
- Integrate with current navigation and layout structure

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for Molstar React component integration
- Integration tests for viewer initialization and basic controls
- Performance tests for rendering and interaction responsiveness
- Browser compatibility tests across target platforms
- Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
