# Story 1.1: Set Up Project Infrastructure and Basic App Shell

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial React/Vite app with Convex integration, including a landing page and basic navigation,
**so that** we have a foundation for the BioAI Workspace application with proper project structure and basic UI shell.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React + Vite + TypeScript project is initialized with proper configuration
2. Convex backend is set up and connected to the frontend
3. Basic landing page is created with navigation structure
4. Project follows the established architecture patterns
5. Development environment is properly configured and documented
6. Basic routing is implemented for future feature expansion

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Initialize React + Vite + TypeScript project (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create new Vite project with React and TypeScript template
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript settings and linting
  - [ ] Set up project structure following architecture guidelines
- [ ] Task 2: Set up Convex backend integration (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Install and configure Convex dependencies
  - [ ] Create Convex project and connect to frontend
  - [ ] Set up basic Convex schema and functions
- [ ] Task 3: Create basic landing page and navigation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Design and implement landing page layout
  - [ ] Create navigation component with routing
  - [ ] Add basic styling and responsive design
- [ ] Task 4: Implement project structure and patterns (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Organize components following React best practices
  - [ ] Set up folder structure for future features
  - [ ] Implement basic state management patterns
- [ ] Task 5: Configure development environment (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Set up development scripts and build process
  - [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets
  - [ ] Create development documentation
- [ ] Task 6: Implement basic routing system (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Set up React Router for navigation
  - [ ] Create route structure for future pages
  - [ ] Add route protection and error handling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundation story for the project.

### Data Models
Based on architecture docs, the following data structures will be needed:
- User model (for authentication) - stored in Convex
- Session model (for persistent state) - stored in Convex
- Basic app configuration - stored in Convex

[Source: docs/architecture/3-component-breakdown.md#convex-backend]

### API Specifications
- Convex functions for user management and session handling
- Basic CRUD operations for user data
- Real-time subscriptions for session state

[Source: docs/architecture/2-system-diagram-flow.md]

### Component Specifications
- Main App component with routing
- Landing page component
- Navigation component
- Basic layout components
- Convex provider wrapper

[Source: docs/architecture/3-component-breakdown.md#frontend]

### File Locations
Based on standard React + Vite patterns:
- `src/` - Main source code
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/pages/` - Page components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
- `convex/` - Convex backend functions and schema
- `public/` - Static assets

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for React components
- Integration tests for Convex functions
- E2E tests for basic user flows
- Testing framework: Standard React testing libraries (Jest, React Testing Library)

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React + Vite + TypeScript as specified in architecture
- Convex integration required for backend functionality
- No external backend servers - everything through Convex
- Must support desktop and tablet (no mobile-first requirement)

[Source: docs/architecture/1-system-overview.md]

### Project Structure Notes
The project should follow standard React + Vite conventions while preparing for the specific BioAI Workspace features. The structure should accommodate future additions like the Molstar viewer, chat interface, and AI integration.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Test Convex functions with Convex testing utilities
- Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
- Follow testing best practices for React applications

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Project initialization and build process
2. Convex connection and basic operations
3. Navigation and routing functionality
4. Responsive design on different screen sizes
5. Environment configuration and deployment

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- Application builds successfully
- Basic navigation works as expected
- Convex integration is functional
- Development environment is properly configured
