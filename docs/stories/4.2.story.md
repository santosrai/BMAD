# Story 4.2: Add Export Capabilities

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** to export molecular structures, viewer images, and conversation data from my BioAI Workspace,
**so that** I can use the data in publications, presentations, and external analysis tools while maintaining research continuity.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can export PDB structure files from the molecular viewer
2. High-quality image export captures current viewer state and selections
3. Chat conversation export includes AI responses and molecular context
4. Multiple export formats support different research workflows (PNG, SVG, PDF, CSV, JSON)
5. Export options include customizable quality, resolution, and content settings
6. Batch export allows multiple items to be exported simultaneously
7. Export history tracks previous exports with metadata and re-export capability
8. Integration with browser download system provides seamless file delivery
9. Export validation ensures data integrity and format compliance
10. Large export operations show progress and support cancellation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Story 4.1**: Session persistence provides rich data context for comprehensive exports
- **From Epic 3**: Complete AI conversation data ready for export and research documentation
- **From Epic 2**: Molecular viewer and PDB data provide exportable structure and visualization content

### Tech Stack & Export Architecture
- **Molstar Export**: Built-in Molstar capabilities for PDB and image generation [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **File Processing**: Client-side export generation with browser download integration
- **Data Formats**: Multiple format support for research workflow compatibility
- **Convex Storage**: Export history and metadata storage for tracking and re-export

### System Integration Points
- **Molecular Viewer**: Export current viewer state, selections, and loaded structures from Epic 2
- **Chat System**: Export conversation history and AI responses from Epic 3
- **Session Data**: Leverage persistent session data from Story 4.1 for comprehensive exports
- **User Preferences**: Export settings and history tied to user profiles from Epic 1

### Export Data Requirements
- **PDB Exports**: Structure data, modifications, user selections, metadata
- **Image Exports**: Current view state, annotations, customizable quality and resolution
- **Conversation Exports**: Message history, AI responses, molecular context, timestamps
- **Metadata**: Export source, settings, creation time, file integrity checksums

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/services/exportManager.ts` - Core export orchestration and file generation
- `src/hooks/useExport.ts` - Custom hooks for export state and progress management
- `src/components/export/` - Export UI components and configuration interfaces
- `src/utils/exportFormats.ts` - Format-specific export generation utilities
- `convex/exports.ts` - Export history and metadata storage functions
- `src/types/export.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for export data structures

### Export Format Specifications
- **PDB Format**: Standard PDB compliance with optional metadata extensions
- **Image Formats**: PNG (web), SVG (vector), high-resolution options for publications
- **Data Formats**: JSON (structured), CSV (tabular), PDF (formatted reports)
- **Archive Formats**: ZIP packaging for multi-file exports and batch operations

### Research Workflow Integration
- **Publication Ready**: High-quality exports suitable for scientific publications
- **Presentation Materials**: Image exports optimized for presentations and posters
- **Data Analysis**: Structured data exports for external analysis tools
- **Documentation**: Formatted conversation reports for research records

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon all previous stories in Epic 4 and earlier epics:
- Integrate with comprehensive session data from Story 4.1
- Leverage complete molecular viewer capabilities from Epic 2
- Export rich AI conversation data from Epic 3
- Follow established UI patterns and user experience from Epic 1

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for export format generation and validation
- Integration tests for viewer state capture and file generation
- Performance tests for large export operations and batch processing
- Cross-browser tests for download functionality and file handling
- Data integrity tests for export accuracy and format compliance
