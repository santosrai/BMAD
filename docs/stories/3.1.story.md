# Story 3.1: Set Up Chat UI and Basic Input

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** to have a chat interface in the BioAI Workspace where I can type natural language queries,
**so that** I can begin interacting with the system conversationally and prepare for AI-powered molecular analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chat interface is embedded in the workspace alongside the molecular viewer
2. Chat input field allows users to type and send messages
3. Chat history displays sent messages and placeholder responses
4. Chat interface integrates with existing authenticated workspace layout
5. Message input supports multi-line text and common formatting
6. Chat history persists across user sessions via Convex storage
7. Loading states indicate when messages are being processed
8. Basic chat controls include send, clear history, and input validation
9. Chat UI follows established design patterns and responsive layout
10. Real-time chat updates work with Convex for collaborative sessions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Epic 1**: User authentication and workspace foundation established with secure session management
- **From Epic 2**: Molecular viewer integrated and functional, ready for AI-driven interactions and updates
- **Workspace Layout**: Established responsive layout patterns ready for chat integration

### Tech Stack & Chat Architecture
- **Chat Interface**: React components integrated with workspace [Source: architecture/2-system-diagram-flow.md]
- **Real-time Chat**: Convex real-time subscriptions for chat history and updates [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Session Management**: Chat persistence tied to user sessions from Epic 1
- **Future AI Ready**: UI foundation prepared for LangGraph.js integration [Source: architecture/2-system-diagram-flow.md]

### System Integration Points
- **Workspace Layout**: Chat panel integrates with existing molecular viewer layout
- **User Sessions**: Chat history tied to authenticated user sessions via Convex
- **Real-time Updates**: Convex subscriptions for live chat synchronization
- **Future AI Bridge**: Chat input/output prepared for LangGraph.js processing pipeline

### Chat Data Requirements
- **Message Structure**: User messages, timestamps, processing status, message IDs
- **Session Context**: Chat history per user session, conversation threading
- **Real-time Sync**: Live updates for chat state and message delivery
- **Export Format**: Structured data for research note export and analysis

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/components/chat/` - Chat interface components (ChatPanel, MessageInput, MessageHistory)
- `src/hooks/useChat.ts` - Custom hooks for chat state management and history
- `src/services/chat.ts` - Chat service layer for message processing
- `convex/chat.ts` - Chat message storage and real-time functions
- `src/types/chat.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for chat data structures
- `src/utils/chatFormatting.ts` - Message formatting and validation utilities

### User Experience Considerations
- **Responsive Design**: Chat interface adapts to different screen sizes alongside viewer
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus management
- **Performance**: Efficient message rendering and history pagination
- **Context Awareness**: Chat maintains context of current molecular structure

### Integration Patterns
- **Layout Management**: Flexible layout system accommodating chat and viewer
- **State Synchronization**: Chat state coordination with viewer context
- **Session Persistence**: Chat history restoration across login sessions
- **Future AI Preparation**: Message format ready for AI processing pipeline

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon Epic 1 and Epic 2 foundations:
- Extend authenticated workspace with chat functionality
- Integrate with established molecular viewer from Epic 2
- Leverage existing Convex integration for real-time chat storage
- Follow established component patterns and styling consistency

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for chat components and message handling logic
- Integration tests for Convex chat storage and real-time updates
- UI tests for chat interface responsiveness and accessibility
- End-to-end tests for complete chat workflow and session persistence
- Performance tests for chat history rendering and real-time updates
