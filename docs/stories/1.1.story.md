# Story 1.1: Set Up Project Infrastructure and Basic App Shell

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the foundational React/Vite/TypeScript application with Convex integration and basic navigation,
**so that** I have a working development environment and app shell ready for implementing user authentication and core features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. React + Vite + TypeScript project is initialized and configured
2. Convex backend is integrated and properly connected to the frontend
3. Basic application structure includes a landing page component
4. Navigation framework is implemented (header/routing foundation)
5. Development environment runs successfully with hot reload
6. Convex development server connects without errors
7. Basic styling framework is configured for consistent UI
8. Build process produces deployable artifacts
9. Project follows established folder structure for scalability

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize React + Vite + TypeScript project (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create new Vite project with React + TypeScript template
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript strict mode and compilation options
  - [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [ ] Set up Convex backend integration (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Install and configure Convex client
  - [ ] Initialize Convex project structure
  - [ ] Configure Convex development environment
  - [ ] Test basic Convex connection from frontend
- [ ] Create basic application structure (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Implement landing page component
  - [ ] Set up React Router for navigation
  - [ ] Create basic header/navigation components
  - [ ] Establish component folder structure
- [ ] Configure styling and UI framework (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Set up CSS framework or styled-components
  - [ ] Create basic design system foundations
  - [ ] Implement responsive layout for desktop/tablet
- [ ] Verify development and build processes (AC: 5, 8)
  - [ ] Test development server with hot reload
  - [ ] Configure production build process
  - [ ] Verify build artifacts are deployable
- [ ] Establish project structure standards (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Create organized folder structure for components, utils, types
  - [ ] Set up import path aliases for clean imports
  - [ ] Document project structure conventions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories (this is the first story in the project).

### Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript [Source: architecture/1-system-overview.md]
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time DB, auth, storage) [Source: architecture/1-system-overview.md]
- **No External Backend**: Convex handles all logic & state [Source: prd/5-technical-assumptions-constraints.md]
- **Target Platforms**: Desktop + tablet support (no mobile-first) [Source: prd/5-technical-assumptions-constraints.md]

### System Integration Points
- **Frontend to Convex**: Direct connection via Convex React hooks [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Future Integrations**: Foundation for LangGraph.js, OpenRouter, and Molstar [Source: architecture/2-system-diagram-flow.md]
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Convex provides real-time state management [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]

### File Structure Requirements
- React components with TypeScript
- Convex backend functions structure
- Scalable folder organization for future AI and viewer components
- Build configuration for production deployment

### Project Structure Notes
This is a greenfield project - establishing initial structure that aligns with:
- React/Vite best practices for TypeScript projects
- Convex integration patterns
- Scalable architecture for future AI workflow and 3D viewer integration

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs - will need to establish testing framework as part of project setup.
