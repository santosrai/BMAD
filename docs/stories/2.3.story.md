# Story 2.3: Enable Basic Viewer Interactions

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** to interact with molecular structures in the 3D viewer through clickable residues and simple controls,
**so that** I can explore specific parts of proteins and have my interactions tracked in my user session for future reference.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can click on individual residues/atoms in the Molstar viewer
2. Clicked residues display information panel with details (residue type, position, properties)
3. Viewer controls include standard navigation tools (zoom, rotate, pan, reset view)
4. Selection highlighting shows clicked residues distinctly from the rest of the structure
5. Multiple residues can be selected and managed (add/remove from selection)
6. User interactions and selections are saved to their Convex session
7. Session-based viewer state persists across navigation and login sessions
8. Basic viewing modes are available (cartoon, surface, ball-and-stick)
9. Users can clear selections and reset viewer state
10. Interaction feedback provides responsive visual and UI updates

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Story 2.1**: Molstar viewer integrated with basic functionality, ready for enhanced interactions
- **From Story 2.2**: PDB structures can be loaded into viewer, providing molecular data for interaction
- **From Epic 1**: User sessions and Convex integration established for persistent state management

### Tech Stack & Viewer Interactions
- **3D Interactions**: Molstar built-in selection and interaction capabilities [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Session Management**: Convex real-time storage for interaction state [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **AI-Ready Interactions**: Foundation for future AI â†” Viewer interaction [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Real-time Updates**: Convex synchronization for interaction history and preferences

### System Integration Points
- **Molstar Events**: Integration with Molstar selection and interaction event system
- **Session Storage**: Real-time saving of interaction states to Convex user sessions
- **UI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing workspace layout and navigation
- **Future AI Bridge**: Interaction data prepared for LangGraph.js integration in future epics

### Interaction Data Requirements
- **Selection State**: Residue IDs, selection coordinates, interaction timestamps
- **Viewer State**: Camera position, viewing mode, display preferences
- **Session History**: Interaction timeline, frequently selected regions, user patterns
- **Performance Data**: Interaction responsiveness, selection complexity metrics

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/components/viewer/interactions/` - Interaction-specific UI components
- `src/hooks/useViewerInteractions.ts` - Custom hooks for interaction state management
- `src/services/viewerState.ts` - Viewer state management and session integration
- `src/utils/residueInfo.ts` - Residue data extraction and formatting utilities
- `convex/viewerSessions.ts` - Viewer interaction storage and retrieval functions
- `src/types/interactions.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for interaction data

### Molstar Integration Patterns
- **Event Handling**: React-friendly wrapper for Molstar selection events
- **State Synchronization**: Bidirectional sync between Molstar state and React state
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient event handling for complex molecular structures
- **Visual Customization**: Custom selection styling and interaction feedback

### User Experience Considerations
- **Responsive Feedback**: Immediate visual response to all interactions
- **Information Accessibility**: Clear, contextual display of molecular information
- **Session Continuity**: Seamless restoration of previous interaction states
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Layered information based on user expertise level

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon Stories 2.1 and 2.2:
- Extend Molstar viewer component with interaction capabilities
- Integrate with established PDB loading pipeline from Story 2.2
- Leverage existing Convex session management from Epic 1
- Follow established component patterns and state management

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for interaction event handling and state management
- Integration tests for Molstar interaction system integration
- UI tests for information display and control responsiveness
- Performance tests for interaction handling with large molecular structures
- Session persistence tests for state restoration and data integrity
