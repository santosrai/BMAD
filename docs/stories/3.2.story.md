# Story 3.2: Integrate LangGraph.js for AI Orchestration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** the chat interface to process my messages through a sophisticated AI orchestration system,
**so that** I can have multi-step conversations about molecular data with contextual memory and tool routing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LangGraph.js is integrated and configured for AI workflow orchestration
2. Chat messages are processed through LangGraph.js workflow engine
3. AI system maintains contextual memory across conversation turns
4. Tool routing system can direct queries to appropriate handlers (molecular data, viewer controls)
5. Multi-step command execution is supported with intermediate feedback
6. Conversation context includes current molecular structure and user selections
7. Workflow state is persisted in Convex for session continuity
8. Error handling manages AI workflow failures gracefully
9. Fallback mechanisms work when AI orchestration is unavailable
10. Performance is optimized for real-time conversational experience

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Story 3.1**: Chat interface established with message processing pipeline ready for AI integration
- **From Epic 2**: Molecular viewer and PDB loading capabilities provide rich context for AI interactions
- **From Epic 1**: User sessions and API key management enable secure AI service integration

### Tech Stack & AI Orchestration
- **AI Framework**: LangGraph.js for multi-step command execution [Source: architecture/1-system-overview.md]
- **Contextual Memory**: LangGraph.js memory for current protein context [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Tool Routing**: LangGraph.js tool routing and fallback capabilities [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Session Integration**: Workflow state persisted via Convex real-time storage

### System Integration Points
- **Chat Pipeline**: Messages flow from chat interface through LangGraph.js to responses
- **Viewer Context**: Current molecular structure and selections inform AI conversations
- **Tool Integration**: AI workflows can trigger viewer updates and PDB operations
- **Memory Persistence**: Conversation context stored in Convex for session continuity

### LangGraph.js Configuration Requirements
- **Workflow Graphs**: Conversation processing, tool routing, multi-step execution
- **Memory Management**: Contextual conversation history and molecular structure state
- **Tool Registry**: Molecular viewer tools, PDB operations, data analysis functions
- **Error Handling**: Robust failure management and fallback strategies

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/services/langgraph/` - LangGraph.js configuration and workflow definitions
- `src/hooks/useAIWorkflow.ts` - Custom hooks for AI workflow management
- `src/tools/molecular/` - Molecular analysis tools for LangGraph integration
- `src/services/aiOrchestrator.ts` - AI orchestration service layer
- `convex/aiWorkflows.ts` - AI workflow state and context storage functions
- `src/types/aiWorkflow.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for AI workflow data

### AI Workflow Patterns
- **Input Processing**: Natural language to workflow routing and execution
- **Context Awareness**: Integration with current viewer state and user selections
- **Multi-step Execution**: Complex workflows with intermediate results and feedback
- **Tool Orchestration**: Coordinated execution of molecular analysis and viewer tools

### Conversation Context Requirements
- **Molecular Context**: Current PDB structure, selected residues, viewing mode
- **User Context**: Research goals, previous queries, session history
- **Workflow State**: Active workflows, pending operations, execution history
- **Tool State**: Available tools, previous tool results, error conditions

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon Stories 3.1 and previous epics:
- Integrate with established chat interface from Story 3.1
- Leverage molecular viewer context from Epic 2 for AI awareness
- Use API key management from Epic 1 for secure AI service access
- Follow established patterns for real-time state management

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for LangGraph.js workflow configuration and execution
- Integration tests for chat-to-AI-to-response pipeline
- Context management tests for conversation continuity
- Tool integration tests for molecular operations
- Performance tests for real-time conversational responsiveness
