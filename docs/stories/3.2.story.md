# Story 3.2: Integrate LangGraph.js for AI Orchestration

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** the chat interface to process my messages through a sophisticated AI orchestration system,
**so that** I can have multi-step conversations about molecular data with contextual memory and tool routing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LangGraph.js is integrated and configured for AI workflow orchestration **on the backend only (Convex/Node.js)**
2. Chat messages are sent from the frontend to the backend API, which processes them through the LangGraph.js workflow engine
3. AI system maintains contextual memory across conversation turns
4. Tool routing system can direct queries to appropriate handlers (molecular data, viewer controls)
5. Multi-step command execution is supported with intermediate feedback
6. Conversation context includes current molecular structure and user selections
7. Workflow state is persisted in Convex for session continuity
8. Error handling manages AI workflow failures gracefully
9. Fallback mechanisms work when AI orchestration is unavailable
10. Performance is optimized for real-time conversational experience

> **Note:** LangGraph.js is not used in the browser/frontend. All workflow orchestration is performed on the backend, and the frontend communicates via API calls only.
