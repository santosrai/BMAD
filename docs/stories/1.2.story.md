# Story 1.2: Implement User Authentication and Account Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to create an account, log in, and manage my profile in the BioAI Workspace,
**so that** I can securely access my personalized workspace and maintain persistent sessions across visits.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can sign up with email/password using Convex auth
2. User can log in with existing credentials
3. User can log out and session is properly terminated
4. User profile page displays user information and allows basic editing
5. Authentication state persists across browser sessions
6. Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
7. Navigation header shows user status (logged in/out) with appropriate actions
8. Password reset/forgot password functionality is implemented
9. Basic user data is stored securely in Convex database
10. Real-time auth state updates across all components

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: React/Vite/TypeScript foundation established with Convex integration, basic navigation framework, and component structure ready for auth implementation.

### Tech Stack & Authentication
- **Frontend Auth**: Convex React hooks for auth state management [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Backend Auth**: Convex built-in user authentication system [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Real-time Auth**: Convex real-time subscriptions for auth state [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Session Management**: Convex handles session persistence automatically [Source: architecture/1-system-overview.md]

### System Integration Points
- **Auth State**: useConvexAuth() hook for real-time authentication status
- **User Data**: Convex database for user profiles and session management
- **Route Protection**: React Router integration with auth state
- **Navigation**: Header/nav components must reflect auth status in real-time

### Data Models & Schemas
- **User Profile**: Standard Convex user schema with profile extensions
- **Session Data**: Managed automatically by Convex auth system
- **User Preferences**: Basic profile information (name, email, preferences)

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/components/auth/` - Authentication UI components (SignUp, Login, Profile)
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Custom auth hooks wrapping Convex auth
- `src/components/layout/` - Auth-aware navigation and header components
- `src/pages/auth/` - Auth-related pages (login, signup, profile, reset)
- `convex/users.ts` - User-related backend functions and schema
- `src/utils/auth.ts` - Auth utilities and route protection helpers

### Authentication Flow Requirements
1. **Sign-up Flow**: Email validation → Account creation → Auto-login → Redirect to workspace
2. **Login Flow**: Credential validation → Session creation → Redirect to last visited or default page
3. **Logout Flow**: Session termination → Redirect to landing page → Clear all auth state
4. **Profile Flow**: Auth-protected access → Real-time data → Optimistic updates

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on all auth forms
- Secure password handling (Convex manages hashing)
- Protected route enforcement
- Session timeout handling
- CSRF protection via Convex security model

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon Story 1.1's foundation:
- Extend existing navigation with auth-aware components
- Integrate with established routing structure
- Follow component organization patterns from Story 1.1
- Leverage existing styling framework for consistent auth UI

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for auth components and hooks
- Integration tests for auth flows (signup, login, logout)
- Route protection testing
- Real-time auth state synchronization tests
- Form validation and error handling tests
