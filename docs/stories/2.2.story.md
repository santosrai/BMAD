# Story 2.2: Implement PDB Search and Load

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** to search for and load PDB molecular structures into the 3D viewer,
**so that** I can explore specific proteins and molecular data relevant to my research within the BioAI Workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PDB search interface allows users to search by PDB ID, protein name, or keywords
2. Search results display relevant PDB entries with metadata (name, organism, resolution)
3. Users can select and load PDB structures directly into the Molstar viewer
4. PDB data is fetched from reliable sources (PDB REST API or similar)
5. Loading states show progress during PDB fetch and viewer loading
6. Error handling provides clear feedback for failed searches or loads
7. Recently loaded PDB structures are stored in user session via Convex
8. Users can access and reload recently used PDB structures
9. Search interface integrates seamlessly with existing authenticated UI
10. File upload capability for local PDB files as alternative input method

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Story 2.1**: Molstar 3D viewer successfully integrated with React, providing target component for PDB structure loading
- **From Epic 1**: User authentication and Convex integration ready for session-based PDB storage and user preferences

### Tech Stack & Data Integration
- **PDB Data Source**: PDB REST API for structure search and retrieval
- **File Storage**: Convex backend for user PDB history and session data [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Viewer Integration**: Direct loading into Molstar viewer from Story 2.1
- **Real-time Updates**: Convex real-time synchronization for PDB session management

### System Integration Points
- **Molstar Viewer**: Integration with viewer component from Story 2.1 for structure loading
- **User Sessions**: PDB history stored in Convex user sessions with real-time sync
- **Search Service**: External PDB API integration with internal caching layer
- **File Management**: Local file upload with client-side validation and processing

### PDB Data Requirements
- **Search Capabilities**: PDB ID lookup, protein name search, keyword-based discovery
- **Metadata Display**: Structure name, organism, resolution, experimental method, publication info
- **File Formats**: Support for standard PDB format and mmCIF files
- **Data Validation**: Client and server-side validation for PDB data integrity

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/components/pdb/` - PDB search and result display components
- `src/services/pdb.ts` - PDB API client and data service layer
- `src/hooks/usePDB.ts` - Custom hooks for PDB search and session management
- `src/utils/pdb.ts` - PDB data parsing and validation utilities
- `convex/pdb.ts` - PDB session storage and user history functions
- `src/types/pdb.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for PDB data structures

### API Integration Patterns
- **PDB REST API**: Standard endpoints for search, metadata, and structure retrieval
- **Caching Strategy**: Convex-based caching for frequently accessed structures
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with rate limiting and retry logic
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API outages or data inconsistencies

### User Experience Considerations
- **Search Performance**: Fast search with debouncing and progressive results
- **Loading Feedback**: Clear progress indicators for potentially slow operations
- **Error Recovery**: User-friendly error messages with actionable next steps
- **Session Continuity**: Seamless access to previously loaded structures

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon Stories 2.1 and Epic 1:
- Integrate with established Molstar viewer component
- Leverage existing Convex backend for data persistence
- Follow established UI patterns and authentication flows
- Extend workspace layout with search and data management features

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for PDB search and data processing logic
- Integration tests for PDB API connectivity and error handling
- UI tests for search interface and result interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete search-to-viewer workflow
- Performance tests for large structure loading and search responsiveness
