# Story 4.1: Implement Session Persistence

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** my chat conversations, molecular structures, and workspace state to automatically save and restore across login sessions,
**so that** I can seamlessly continue my research work without losing progress or context when I return to the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chat conversations automatically save to Convex in real-time during user interactions
2. Molecular viewer state (loaded structures, selections, viewing modes) persists across sessions
3. AI workflow context and conversation memory restore properly after login
4. Session restoration happens automatically upon user authentication
5. Multiple session management allows users to have different research contexts
6. Session data includes timestamps and metadata for organization and retrieval
7. Auto-save indicators provide feedback on successful data persistence
8. Session cleanup manages storage limits and removes old/unused sessions
9. Offline state changes queue for synchronization when connection resumes
10. Data integrity ensures no loss during network interruptions or browser crashes

- **Viewer Sessions**: Loaded PDB structures, user selections, viewing modes, interaction history
- **AI Context**: Conversation memory, tool states, workflow execution history
- **User Preferences**: Interface settings, model selections, workspace layout preferences

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/services/sessionManager.ts` - Core session persistence and restoration logic
- `src/hooks/useSessionPersistence.ts` - Custom hooks for session state management

### Auto-Save Implementation Patterns
- **Incremental Saves**: Efficient delta updates for large session data
- **Debounced Persistence**: Optimized save frequency to prevent performance issues
- **Critical Path Priority**: Immediate save for critical data (AI responses, structure loads)
- **Background Sync**: Non-blocking synchronization for continuous user experience

### Data Integrity and Recovery
- **Version Control**: Session versioning for rollback and conflict resolution
- **Checksums**: Data integrity validation for session restoration
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery from partial failures or corruption
- **Backup Strategy**: Redundant storage for critical session data

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon all previous epics:
- Integrate with complete chat and AI system from Epic 3
- Extend molecular viewer state management from Epic 2
- Leverage user authentication and Convex infrastructure from Epic 1
- Follow established patterns for real-time data synchronization

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for session serialization and persistence logic
- Integration tests for cross-session data restoration
- Performance tests for auto-save frequency and large session data
- Network interruption tests for offline scenarios and data integrity
