# Story 5.3: Integrate Python Service with Existing Backend

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** system integrator,
**I want** seamless integration between the Python microservice and existing Convex backend,
**so that** the frontend continues to work without any changes while benefiting from real molecular analysis capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Update `convex/langgraphWorkflow.ts` action to proxy requests to Python microservice API
2. Maintain exact same function signatures and response formats for backward compatibility
3. Implement HTTP client with retry logic, timeouts, and circuit breaker patterns
4. Add fallback mechanisms to TypeScript mock tools when Python service is unavailable
5. Environment configuration for Python service URL and connection parameters
6. Request/response transformation layer to maintain existing data contracts
7. Error mapping between Python service responses and existing Convex error formats
8. Health monitoring integration to track Python service availability
9. Performance monitoring and logging for request routing and response times
10. Zero breaking changes to existing React frontend components and hooks

> **Note:** This integration maintains all existing frontend functionality from Epic 3 while transparently upgrading the backend processing to use real scientific computing capabilities.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
- **Zero Downtime Migration**: Fallback ensures continuous service during Python deployment
- **API Contract Maintenance**: Critical to maintain existing React component compatibility
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track latency impact from network calls to Python service
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error mapping maintains existing user experience
- **Configuration Management**: Service URLs and timeouts configurable via environment
