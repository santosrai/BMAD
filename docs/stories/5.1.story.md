# Story 5.1: Build Python LangGraph Microservice Foundation

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** system architect,
**I want** a robust Python LangGraph microservice foundation with FastAPI,
**so that** we can migrate from TypeScript to Python-based AI workflows with proper containerization, monitoring, and integration capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. FastAPI application created with LangGraph Python integration and OpenAPI documentation
2. Docker containerization with multi-stage builds for production deployment
3. Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`) for monitoring and orchestration
4. LangGraph Python agents configured for workflow orchestration (replacing TypeScript engine)
5. Environment configuration for OpenRouter API integration and service settings
6. Async request processing for handling concurrent workflow executions
7. Structured logging with correlation IDs for debugging and monitoring
8. Error handling and graceful shutdown mechanisms implemented
9. Service discovery configuration for integration with existing Convex backend
10. Basic authentication/authorization framework for API security

> **Note:** This service will eventually replace the TypeScript LangGraph implementation in `src/services/langgraph/workflowEngine.ts` but initial deployment focuses on foundation infrastructure.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up Python project structure and dependencies (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Initialize Poetry/pip project with FastAPI, LangGraph, Pydantic
  - [ ] Configure project structure following microservice patterns
  - [ ] Install scientific computing dependencies (BioPython, RDKit preparation)
  - [ ] Set up development environment and testing framework

- [ ] Implement FastAPI application foundation (AC: 1, 6, 8)
  - [ ] Create FastAPI app with OpenAPI documentation
  - [ ] Implement async request handling and worker pools
  - [ ] Add middleware for CORS, request logging, and error handling
  - [ ] Create graceful shutdown handlers for long-running processes

- [ ] Configure LangGraph Python agents (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Initialize LangGraph Python workflow engine
  - [ ] Create base agent configurations matching TypeScript functionality
  - [ ] Implement workflow state management and persistence
  - [ ] Test basic agent execution and orchestration

- [ ] Add monitoring and health checks (AC: 3, 7)
  - [ ] Implement `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
  - [ ] Add structured logging with JSON formatting
  - [ ] Configure correlation ID tracking across requests
  - [ ] Set up basic metrics collection for performance monitoring

- [ ] Implement containerization (AC: 2, 9)
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
  - [ ] Configure docker-compose for local development
  - [ ] Add container health checks and resource limits
  - [ ] Test container deployment and service discovery

- [ ] Configure API integration layer (AC: 5, 10)
  - [ ] Environment variable configuration for OpenRouter
  - [ ] Basic API key authentication framework
  - [ ] Request validation and rate limiting setup
  - [ ] Integration testing with mock Convex calls

## Dev Notes
- **Architecture Decision**: Using FastAPI for performance and async capabilities
- **LangGraph Migration**: Python LangGraph provides richer scientific library ecosystem
- **Deployment Strategy**: Container-first approach for scalability and maintenance
- **Security Considerations**: API authentication required before production deployment
- **Performance Target**: <200ms service startup time, <50ms health check response

## Change Log
- **2024-01-XX**: Story created during Epic 5 planning
- **TBD**: Implementation start date

## Dev Agent Record
