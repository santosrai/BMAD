# Story 3.3: Connect to OpenRouter and Handle Responses

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** the AI system to connect to multiple language models through OpenRouter using my API key,
**so that** I can have intelligent conversations about molecular data with model flexibility and optimized performance for my research needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LangGraph.js integrates with OpenRouter using user-provided API keys from settings
2. Multiple AI models are available for selection (GPT, Claude, Mixtral, etc.)
3. AI responses are processed and displayed naturally in the chat interface
4. Model switching allows users to choose optimal models for different tasks
5. Response streaming provides real-time feedback during AI generation
6. Error handling manages API failures, rate limits, and invalid responses
7. Cost and usage tracking helps users monitor their API consumption
8. Response quality includes proper formatting and molecular data integration
9. Latency optimization ensures responsive conversational experience
10. Fallback mechanisms work when preferred models are unavailable
