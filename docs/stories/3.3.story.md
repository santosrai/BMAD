# Story 3.3: Connect to OpenRouter and Handle Responses

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** researcher,
**I want** the AI system to connect to multiple language models through OpenRouter using my API key,
**so that** I can have intelligent conversations about molecular data with model flexibility and optimized performance for my research needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LangGraph.js integrates with OpenRouter using user-provided API keys from settings
2. Multiple AI models are available for selection (GPT, Claude, Mixtral, etc.)
3. AI responses are processed and displayed naturally in the chat interface
4. Model switching allows users to choose optimal models for different tasks
5. Response streaming provides real-time feedback during AI generation
6. Error handling manages API failures, rate limits, and invalid responses
7. Cost and usage tracking helps users monitor their API consumption
8. Response quality includes proper formatting and molecular data integration
9. Latency optimization ensures responsive conversational experience
10. Fallback mechanisms work when preferred models are unavailable

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **From Story 3.1**: Chat interface ready for AI response integration and display
- **From Story 3.2**: LangGraph.js orchestration established, ready for model provider integration
- **From Epic 1**: User API key management and secure storage enable OpenRouter access

### Tech Stack & Model Integration
- **Model Gateway**: OpenRouter for multi-model access [Source: architecture/1-system-overview.md]
- **User API Keys**: BYO key model with secure storage [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Model Flexibility**: Configurable latency/cost optimization [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md]
- **Cost Control**: User key support for usage management [Source: prd/5-technical-assumptions-constraints.md]

### System Integration Points
- **API Key Retrieval**: Secure access to user OpenRouter API keys from Story 1.3
- **LangGraph Integration**: Model provider integration with established AI workflows
- **Chat Display**: Response integration with chat interface from Story 3.1
- **Usage Tracking**: Cost and performance monitoring stored in Convex

### OpenRouter Configuration Requirements
- **Model Support**: GPT, Claude, Mixtral and other available models
- **API Configuration**: Secure key management and request authentication
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response generation and display
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive failure management and recovery

### File Structure Requirements
- `src/services/openrouter/` - OpenRouter client and model management
- `src/hooks/useOpenRouter.ts` - Custom hooks for model interaction and state
- `src/components/chat/ModelSelector.tsx` - Model selection UI component
- `src/services/responseProcessor.ts` - Response parsing and formatting
- `convex/apiUsage.ts` - Usage tracking and cost monitoring functions
- `src/types/openrouter.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for OpenRouter integration

### Response Processing Requirements
- **Streaming Responses**: Progressive display with proper formatting
- **Molecular Integration**: Response content aware of current viewer state
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of partial or failed responses
- **Quality Validation**: Response completeness and relevance checking

### Cost and Usage Management
- **Request Tracking**: Monitor API calls, tokens, and costs per user session
- **Usage Analytics**: Historical usage patterns and model performance
- **Cost Estimation**: Real-time cost calculation and user budgeting
- **Alert System**: Notifications for usage thresholds and spending limits

### Project Structure Notes
Build upon all previous stories in Epic 3:
- Integrate with established LangGraph.js workflows from Story 3.2
- Leverage chat interface and user experience from Story 3.1
- Use secure API key management from Epic 1 Story 1.3
- Connect with molecular context from Epic 2 for intelligent responses

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for OpenRouter client and response processing
- Integration tests for LangGraph.js and OpenRouter connectivity
- Error handling tests for various API failure scenarios
- Performance tests for response latency and streaming
- Cost tracking tests for usage monitoring accuracy
