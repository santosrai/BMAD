"# Epic 2: Molecular Visualization and Data Loading - Greenfield Development

## Epic Goal

Implement the 3D molecular viewer with PDB search/load capabilities to enable users to visualize and interact with biological structures, building on the foundation to provide core value for researchers and learners.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Basic auth and settings from Epic 1.
- Technology stack: Molstar for 3D viewer, Convex for data storage, React for UI.
- Integration points: Viewer embedded in React app; PDB data fetched and stored via Convex.

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Integrate Molstar viewer, add PDB search functionality, and enable loading of molecular data.
- How it integrates: Viewer component in React; data flows through Convex for persistence.
- Success criteria: Users can search/load PDB files, view in 3D, and interact (e.g., zoom, select); measured by successful loads and viewer interactions.

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Integrate Molstar 3D Viewer** - Embed Molstar in the React app with basic viewing capabilities.
2. **Story 2: Implement PDB Search and Load** - Add search interface to fetch PDB data and load into the viewer.
3. **Story 3: Enable Basic Viewer Interactions** - Add clickable residues and simple controls linked to user sessions.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged.
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible.
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns.
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Performance issues with 3D rendering.
- **Mitigation:** Optimize viewer config and test on target devices.
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable viewer component and revert data schema changes.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing.
- [ ] Integration points working correctly.
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately.
- [ ] No regression in existing features."
