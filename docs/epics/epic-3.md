"# Epic 3: AI-Powered Chat Interface - Greenfield Development

## Epic Goal

Build the natural language chat system with LangGraph.js and OpenRouter integration to allow conversational AI interactions for analysis and commands, enabling users to query and manipulate molecular data via chat.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: User management and molecular viewer from previous epics.
- Technology stack: LangGraph.js for AI orchestration, OpenRouter for models, Convex for state.
- Integration points: Chat UI in React; AI responses update viewer via events.

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Implement chat interface, AI routing with LangGraph, and model integration.
- How it integrates: Chat connects to OpenRouter via user API keys; state managed in Convex.
- Success criteria: Users can send queries, receive responses, and see viewer updates; measured by session depth metrics.

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Set Up Chat UI and Basic Input** - Create React components for chat interface.
2. **Story 2: Integrate LangGraph.js for AI Orchestration** - Implement multi-step AI execution.
3. **Story 3: Connect to OpenRouter and Handle Responses** - Enable model switching and response processing.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged.
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible.
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns.
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** AI latency affecting user experience.
- **Mitigation:** Implement loading states and fallback mechanisms.
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable AI features and revert to static viewer.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing.
- [ ] Integration points working correctly.
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately.
- [ ] No regression in existing features."
