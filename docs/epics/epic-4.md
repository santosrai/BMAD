"# Epic 4: Session Persistence and Advanced Capabilities - Greenfield Development

## Epic Goal

Add auto-save for chats and molecule states, plus power-user features like exports and model switching to enhance usability and retention, completing the V1 feature set for a polished product.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Full chat and viewer from previous epics.
- Technology stack: Convex for persistence, Molstar for exports.
- Integration points: Real-time saving to Convex; export functions tied to viewer.

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Implement session auto-save, export tools, and advanced settings.
- How it integrates: Leverage Convex real-time features for persistence.
- Success criteria: Sessions persist across logins; exports work; measured by retention metrics.

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Implement Session Persistence** - Auto-save chat history and viewer state to Convex.
2. **Story 2: Add Export Capabilities** - Enable PDB/image exports from viewer.
3. **Story 3: Enhance with Advanced Features** - Add model switching and upload for private files.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged.
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible.
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns.
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Data loss in persistence.
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust saving with error handling.
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove persistence features and clean up schema.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing.
- [ ] Integration points working correctly.
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately.
- [ ] No regression in existing features."
